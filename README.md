🛰️ Real-Time Location Sharing App
- This is a simple web application that allows users to share their live location and view others in real-time on a map. It uses:

- Geolocation API to get the user's current position

- Socket.IO for real-time updates between clients

- Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap to display user locations

--- It's a good project to understand how real-time data works in web applications.
